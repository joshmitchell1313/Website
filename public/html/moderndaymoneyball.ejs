                    <h2>"The <em>Art </em> of <em>Winning</em> an Unfair Game"</h2>
                    <p>For my undergraduate thesis, I conducted a study called Modern Day Moneyball. The purpose of this study 
                      is to offer an intuitive and cost-efficient approach on how to run a major league baseball team. In the sports world and particularly in baseball, there is a great 
                      deal of financial mismanagement where teams are overspending to assemble their rosters. To 
                      combat this issue and create a cost-effective but competitive roster, I hired myself as the General 
                      Manager of the Los Angeles Angels from 2012 to 2019.
                      With the use of the Python programming language, over 200,000 data points were
                      scraped from the internet and stored into the SQLite database. The trends discovered from the 
                      data were then applied to different styles of management classified as models. The main model 
                      that was used for this research was deemed the homegrown model. 
                      To compare whether the model I assembled was better than the real-life roster, a baseball 
                      simulation engine, Out of This Park Baseball â€™21 completed 160 simulations and the figures 
                      were placed into the Pythagorean Theorem of Baseball. The theorem was then able to determine 
                      which model would bring the most success in terms of wins to an organization over the 
                      designated period. After the analysis was completed, it was found that the patient Homegrown 
                      Model was much more effective at creating success versus a more aggressive All-In Model. 
                      Although not every reader may have a passion for the sport of baseball, I believe that the 
                      methodology that is executed will encourage others to apply it to their own professions.</p>

            <p>Despite spending the 4th largest amount of money out of all thirty teams, the Los Angeles Angels have found the same amount of success as teams that rank towards the bottom of the league. Here are a few rankings from 2012-2019.</p>

            <img src="../css/moderndaymoneyball/assets/images/heading-line-dec.png" alt="">
            <p>The Homegrown Model was the model proposed in the research paper and argued how organizations should philosophically build their teams. The Model places an emphasis on moving away from emotionally based decision-making. The goal is to never spend the most money on a free agent, but rather build through the draft and acquire as many young assets as one can. A large majority of the money will be allocated towards players for contract extensions and maintaing the that was developed internally. Once this franchise is deemed competitive(can reach the 90 win mark), the team will look to the trade and free agent markets to fill out the roster. The Los Angeles Dodgers and Kansas City Royals of 2010's are excellent examples of this approach. I believe that it is much more effective avoiding bad contracts in the long run and creating a team that has the potential to be better every year. Nothing is ever guarenteed, but the job of the general manager is to put the team in the best position to stay competitive over the longest period of time possible. If one chooses to go all-in to win a title in a single year, there will be little future left after that year is complete. If a team chooses to do a full rebuild, the organization may lose out on a large amount of revenue because the average fan is not interested in watching a bad team. </p>
